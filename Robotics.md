# FIRST Robotics Compititon
## What I did
From grade 8-12 I was on FRC. starting in my second year I began taking on leadership, helping to integrate CAD into team for the first time and running control systems including the teamâ€™s first-time using CAN. While doing CAD I worked with our Sheetmetal supplier to switch the team to using a unibody sheet metal chassis reducing frame components from ~40 to just 3 (unibody and 2 machined sub frames for drive component mounting). The first set of images is from that first year where I was responsible for chassis and control system. The second is from my last year where I was team captain and managed the entire robot development with a team of 7 people.
