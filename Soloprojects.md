# 2019 FSAE Acumulator
## What I did
For our 2019 accumulator I led the development of the Frame (ESCF) and what we call the aux tray that housed all of the segment to segment bussing, bms and safty sysytems
## What I learned
1. Think through tollarance and what they will mean in the real world especially when dealling with over 300v
2. When welding peices togeather (especially aluminum) think through how the part will warp and plan for fixturing to account for it
