# 2019 FSAE Accumulator
## What I did
For our 2019 accumulator I led the development of the Frame (ESCF) and what we call the aux tray that housed all of the segment-to-segment bussing, BMS and safety systems
## What I learned
1. Think through tolerance and what they will mean in the real world especially when dealing with over 300v.
2. When welding pieces together (especially aluminum) think through how the part will warp and plan for fixturing to account for it.
3. Carefully planning manufacturing techniques is important to do at an early stage while planning packaging.
4. This was the first time I worked with weldments in FEA, carefully modeling bond area and stiffness was a key to proving crash loads on the frame
