# EXPERIENCE

**Tesla -**  **Vehicle Integration Design Engineering Intern** May 2021 - Present

- Managed the integration efforts of a new product variant, including presenting on scope decisions, setting up BOM structure, and finding and assigning issue to drive development.
- Planned and executed a multi-day event with manufacturing and service engineers to identify and assign over 30 specific design improvements to reduce assembly and service times.
- Established and led relevant cross functional teams to make design changes across multiple systems based on testing failures allowing complex design issues to be resolved in weeks instead of months.
- Procured and Designed stand in parts for test allowing use of shorter lead time process to simulate production parts allowing tests to 3 weeks sooner than otherwise
- Used CATIA V6 to make assembly concepts allowing for team alignment early on reducing design conflicts later in design.

**MacDon Industries -**  **Co-Op Test Technician** May 2020 – December 2020

- Managed field testing for two unique Draper Header prototypes in locations across the United States
- Worked with design engineers to implement a key design change to knife guard mounting after prototypes experienced premature knife failures
- Implemented four large frame level design changes based on field failures and customer feedback
- Utilized Solid Edge to design sheet metal components for test device enclosures reducing test set up and transportation time
- Created a macro in Microsoft Excel to quickly collect data from daily field reports allowing for faster data analysis without manual data entry

**UMSAE Formula Electric (Formula SAE)** August 2018 - Present

**Accumulator Lead** May 2019 – Present

- Managed a team of six people in the mechanical design, procurement and manufacturing of the Formula SAE high voltage battery pack
- Utilized SolidWorks to redesign cell restraint reducing battery pack segments from 12 to 4
- Worked with electrical engineering students to redesign the high current path to reduce bus bar components per cell set from six to three, reducing expected assembly time by 20%
- Created a custom heat transfer simulation program in Python to specify heatsinks and fans
- Performed basic CFD in STAR-CCM+ to optimize cell spacing in the next generation high voltage battery pack, allowing an increase in volumetric density of ~10%
- Reduced overall battery pack volume by ~15% compared to previous design

**Mechanical Design Intern** August 2018 - May 2019

- Worked across sub-teams to better integrate components and improve documentation
- Created a standardized hardware library for use in all designs reducing unique part numbers required for vehicle assembly
- Updated the design of vehicle pedal platform using SolidWorks Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to improve stiffness while allowing adjustability
- Designed the Formula SAE electric battery frame and enclosure in SolidWorks
- Utilized ANSYS and NASTRAN to perform FEA on the high voltage battery pack reducing weight from over 70 lbs. to 36 lbs.
